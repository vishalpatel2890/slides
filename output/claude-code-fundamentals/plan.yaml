  - "Quick installation and hands-on experience"
  - "Decision framework for Claude Code vs Claude.ai vs API"

# Purpose & Outcome
purpose: "Educational workshop to understand what Claude Code is, installation, and first interactions"
desired_outcome: "SEs can install, use, and demo Claude Code to customers"
key_message: "Claude Code transforms how you work with AI - from asking questions to working alongside an agent that takes action in your environment"

# Narrative Structure
storyline:
  opening_hook: "You already know how to explain AI to customers. But what if you could show them AI working with them in real-time?"
  tension: "There's a gap between 'chat with AI' and 'AI that does work.' Customers don't grasp the paradigm shift - and most SEs haven't experienced it either."
  resolution: "Claude Code bridges that gap. It's an agent that works in your environment, with your code, taking real action while you guide it."
  call_to_action: "Install it today, build your first demo script, and transform how you demonstrate AI value to customers."

recurring_themes:
  - "Paradigm shift"
  - "Agent vs chatbot"
  - "Practical SE workflows"
  - "Hands-on learning"
