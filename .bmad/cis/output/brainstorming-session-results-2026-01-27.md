# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2026-01-27
**Facilitator:** {{agent_role}} {{agent_name}}
**Participant:** Vishal

## Session Start

**Approach Selected:** AI-Recommended Techniques (Option 2)

**Techniques Chosen:**
1. Role Playing (collaborative) - Stakeholder perspective exploration
2. SCAMPER Method (structured) - Systematic mode expansion
3. What If Scenarios (creative) - Boundary-pushing ideation

**Rationale:** Focused product ideation benefits from grounded user perspectives (Role Playing), systematic exploration of existing concepts (SCAMPER), and creative expansion (What If). Progression moves from empathy → structure → creativity.

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Slide Builder Mode Selection - What modes should an AI agent use when building slides for users?

**Session Goals:** Identify additional slide-building modes beyond the three already defined (generate from scratch, pick from catalog, customize template). Context: Enterprise presentations requiring brand guideline compliance, users typically have several days to prepare.
